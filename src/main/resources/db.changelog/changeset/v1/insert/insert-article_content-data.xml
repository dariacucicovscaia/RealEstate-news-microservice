                    value="New analysis from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) suggests that while most borrowers will be able to handle this adjustment, some will struggle. This includes some borrowers who won't be able to make their higher repayments and others who will be unable to refinance.Mortgage rates have more than doubled over the past year, up 3.5 percentage points. While many borrowers continue to be shielded from higher repayments by fixed rate periods, the majority of these low rates will expire over the next year.Along with cost-of-living pressures from high inflation, 2023 is shaping to be a nervous year for many households.But how large are the risks for borrowers? Will repayments increase enough to force people to sell properties or go into default? And will there be significant numbers of ‘mortgage prisoners’ who aren’t able to refinance for a better deal?The RBA's most recent Financial Stability Review looks at these risks in depth."/>
